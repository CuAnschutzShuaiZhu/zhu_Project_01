## First attempt

```{r}
library(knitr)
df <- read.csv('../DataRaw/lead-iq-01.csv')
df[df$IQ==999,2] <- 99 
boxplot(df$IQ~df$Smelter,main = 'Boxplot of IQ',
        xlab = 'Distance from lead smelter',
        ylab = 'IQ')
```

```{r}
summary_table <- function(df){
  table <- rbind(summary(df[df$Smelter=='Far',]$IQ),
        summary(df[df$Smelter=='Near',]$IQ))
  colnames(table) <- c('Min', '1st_Qu', 'Median',	'Mean',	'3rd_Qu',	'Max') 
  rownames(table) <- c('Far','Near')
  return (kable(table, format = 'html',
                caption = 'Summary table of IQ value on Far from lead smelter and Near lead smelter')
          )
}
summary_table(df)
```

I replaced the IQ 999 as 99. From the box plots, Four outlier this time, But my conclusion doesn't change. Living far from the lead smelter has a trend of high IQ score.
